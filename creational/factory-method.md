# Factory Method Pattern

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Use Factory Method Pattern when

  * You donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
  * You want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.
