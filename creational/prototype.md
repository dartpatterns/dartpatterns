# Prototype Pattern

Prototype is a creational design pattern that let you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

Wikipedia: [Prototype Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern).

### Use Prototype Pattern when

* Your code shouldn't depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
* You want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.
