# Singleton Pattern

Singleton is a creational design pattern that let you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

Wikipedia: [Singleton Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern).

### Use Singleton Pattern when

* A class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients.
* You need stricter control over global variables.
