# Builder Pattern

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Wikipedia: [Builder Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern).

### Use Builder Pattern when

  * To get rid of a "telescoping constructor".
  * You want your code to be able to create different representations of some product.
  * To construct Composite trees or other complex objects.
